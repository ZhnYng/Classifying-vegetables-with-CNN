This project focuses on classifying vegetables using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow. Various architectures such as CNN, VGG, and ResNet have been explored to achieve accurate classification results.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying images of different types of vegetables. CNNs are well-suited for this task as they can effectively capture spatial hierarchies in the images, enabling robust feature extraction and classification.

## Implemented Architectures

1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A basic CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

2. **VGG (Visual Geometry Group)**: A deep CNN architecture with a stack of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

3. **ResNet (Residual Neural Network)**: A deep CNN architecture with residual connections, which alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and enable training of very deep networks.
